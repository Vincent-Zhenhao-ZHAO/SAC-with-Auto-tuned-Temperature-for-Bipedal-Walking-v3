# SAC with Auto-tuned Temperature for Bipedal Walking v3

## ðŸš€ Introduction

Welcome to our project! In this project, I applied a modified version of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) as part of my Reinforcement Learning course, the aim of the coursework is to master the complexities of bipedal locomotion in the Bipedal-Walking-v3 environment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Achievements

- **Standard Environment**: Rapid convergence with a score of 300 at episode 117, shows convergence at the beginning of the 200 episode.
