# ü§ñ SAC with Auto-tuned Temperature for Bipedal Walking v3

## üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the exploration of bipedal locomotion mastery in the Bipedal-Walking-v3 environment! This project encompasses the application of a modified Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm as a part of my Reinforcement Learning course, aiming to skillfully navigate through the challenges and complexities of bipedal movement.
